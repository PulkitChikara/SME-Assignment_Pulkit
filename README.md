****Problem****

In the second part of the assignment, I encountered a significant challenge caused by a circular dependency between the PlayerView and PlayerController classes. Circular dependencies occur when two or more modules depend on each other, directly or indirectly, leading to compilation errors and making code maintenance difficult.

By removing the #include PlayerController.h statement from PlayerView.h and replacing it with a forward declaration of PlayerController, the code compiled successfully. This approach not only resolved the compilation error but also improved code maintainability by breaking the tight coupling between the two classes.

Addressing circular dependencies is crucial for ensuring code modularity, scalability, and ease of maintenance in software development projects. By employing techniques like forward declaration, developers can effectively manage dependencies and build robust, flexible systems.

**Exploring the Weapon System Architecture for a First-Person Shooter Game.**

Hello, everyone! Are you prepared to explore the exciting world of weapon systems in first-person shooter games? Let's work together to create an architecture that will make your game's weapon system extraordinary.

**Designing the Architecture**
Let's break down the system into its components and examine how they interact with each other.

**1. Player Class**
Player class manages the player's actions and is equipped with weaponry.

**Attributes**
equippedPrimaryGuns: Array storing two primary guns.

equippedSecondaryGun: Pointer to the secondary gun.

currentAmmo: Tracks the current ammo count.

totalAmmo: Total ammo available for all guns.

Responsibilities:
Equip and switch weapons.

Use the attached weapon.

**2. Weapon Class.**
The weapon class describes the features and how the weapon is going to behave in the game.

Attributes:
ammo: Current ammo count.

magazineSize: Maximum ammo capacity per magazine.

fireRate: Rate of fire.

reloadTime: Duration taken to reload the weapon.

Responsibilities:
Manage the ammo count and reloading

Control the firing rate

**3. UI Class.**
The UI class manages the heads-up display (HUD), it is a class that helps in getting the feedback to the player.

Attributes
equippedWeaponsHUD: Array displaying equipped weapons.

currentAmmoHUD: Displays current ammo count.

totalAmmoHUD: Displays total ammo count.


Responsibilities:
Display the currently equipped weapons.

Show current and total ammunition.

Now, let's observe how these classes interact with one another.

The Player Class will communicate with the UI Class to update the HUD with the presently equipped weaponâ€™s ammunition counts.
When the player fires a weapon, the Player Class communicates with the Weapon Class, which will remove ammo from the magazine and will handle reloading if necessary.

**Conclusion**
By structuring our weapon system architecture, we provide a clear separation of concerns and easy communication among various components. The player can manage their guns through the UI, while the weapon class handles the firing and reloading mechanisms.

This architecture will help you create a compelling and immersive first-person shooter experience!

Let's continue refining and implementing this architecture to bring our game to life!
